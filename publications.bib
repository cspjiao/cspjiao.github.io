	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) empowers multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global generalization model without the need to share their local data, thus reducing privacy risks and expanding the scope of AI applications. However, current works focus less on data in a highly nonidentically distributed manner such as graph data which are common in reality, and ignore the problem of model personalization between clients for graph data training in federated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel personality graph federated learning framework based on variational graph autoencoders that incorporates model contrastive learning and local fine-tuning to achieve personalized federated training on graph data for each client, which is called FedVGAE. Then we introduce an encoder-sharing strategy to the proposed framework that shares the parameters of the encoder layer to further improve personality performance. The node classification and link prediction experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than other federated learning methods on most graph datasets in the non-iid setting. Finally, we conduct ablation experiments, the result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {The network alignment task aims to identify the correspondence of the same nodes across networks, which plays a crucial role in many fields. However, most existing methods focus solely on consistency assumptions at the local structure information of nodes, meaning that the alignment of neighboring node pairs tends to be consistent with each other, while ignoring information from other scales, such as higher-order information. This can easily lead to over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale embedding-based network alignment method in this paper. Specifically, we capture three types of node embedding information, including first-order embedding, multi-order embedding, and higher-order embedding, to obtain rich information. Then, we enhance the multi-order and higher-order embedding information of nodes by applying a stable-pair based fine-tuning method. Finally, we use a fusion mechanism based on importance weights to combine the alignment matrices obtained from these three types of node embedding information and obtain the optimal alignment matrix. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

	abstract = {Medical image segmentation annotations exhibit variations among experts due to the ambiguous boundaries of segmented objects and backgrounds in medical images. Although using multiple annotations for each image in the fully-supervised has been extensively studied for training deep models, obtaining a large amount of multi-annotated data is challenging due to the substantial time and manpower costs required for segmentation annotations, resulting in most images lacking any annotations. To address this, we propose Multi-annotated Semi-supervised Ensemble Networks (MSE-Nets) for learning segmentation from limited multi-annotated and abundant unannotated data. Specifically, we introduce the Network Pairwise Consistency Enhancement (NPCE) module and Multi-Network Pseudo Supervised (MNPS) module to enhance MSE-Nets for the segmentation task by considering two major factors: (1) to optimize the utilization of all accessible multi-annotated data, the NPCE separates (dis)agreement annotations of multi-annotated data at the pixel level and handles agreement and disagreement annotations in different ways, (2) to mitigate the introduction of imprecise pseudo-labels, the MNPS extends the training data by leveraging consistent pseudo-labels from unannotated data. Finally, we improve confidence calibration by averaging the predictions of base networks. Experiments on the ISIC dataset show that we reduced the demand for multi-annotated data by 97.75{\textbackslash}\% and narrowed the gap with the best fully-supervised baseline to just a Jaccard index of 4{\textbackslash}\%. Furthermore, compared to other semi-supervised methods that rely only on a single annotation or a combined fusion approach, the comprehensive experimental results on ISIC and RIGA datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in medical image segmentation with ambiguous boundaries.},

	abstract = {Temporal graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional dynamic node embeddings to capture temporal information as well as structural and property information. Current representation learning methods for temporal networks often focus on capturing fine-grained information, which may lead to the model capturing random noise instead of essential semantic information. While graph contrastive learning has shown promise in dealing with noise, it only applies to static graphs or snapshots and may not be suitable for handling time-dependent noise. To alleviate the above challenge, we propose a novel Temporal Graph representation learning with Adaptive augmentation Contrastive (TGAC) model. The adaptive augmentation on the temporal graph is made by combining prior knowledge with temporal information, and the contrastive objective function is constructed by defining the augmented inter-view contrast and intra-view contrast. To complement TGAC, we propose three adaptive augmentation strategies that modify topological features to reduce noise from the network. Our extensive experiments on various real networks demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other temporal graph representation learning methods.},

	abstract = {Exploring the differences and important patterns of nodes from the perspective of roles has gradually developed into an interesting and important topic in network analysis. However, existing role-oriented network embedding methods focus more on identifying underlying roles for static network, which leads to complex temporal behaviors being overlooked and degraded performance facing dynamic network. The few role analytics methods for dynamic networks either cannot learn general node representations or fail to discovery role transitions of nodes. In this work, we propose a unified framework RDNE (Role-oriented Dynamic Network Embedding) to tackle such challenges, which aim to learn multiple embeddings for individual nodes based on time-varying structural behaviors. Based on regular equivalence, RDNE propagates the structural features over the graph to derive the initial role-oriented representations. Then, it applies capsule network to further model the mapping between nodes and roles, which is the first time capsule network is used for role discovery. For the varying and temporal dependence within dynamic network, we utilize the Gated Recurrent Unit to compute historical information and use historical information to influence the generation of representations at the next snapshot. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks validate the superiority of the proposed RDNE.},

However, existing works have paid very much attention to learning structures on homogeneous networks, while the related study on heterogeneous networks is still void. In this article, we try to take the first step for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying structures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures, we first propose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous walk (HAW) and give two more applicable variants. Then, we devise the HAW embedding (HAWE) and its variants in a data-driven manner to circumvent using an extremely large number of possible walks and train embeddings by predicting occurring walks in the neighborhood of each node. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure learning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate our methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classic methods and can be applied on large-scale networks.},

However, the GCN aggregating mechanism fails to generalize to networks with heterophily where most nodes have neighbors from different classes, which commonly exists in real-world networks. In order to make the propagation and aggregation mechanism of GCN suitable for both homophily and heterophily (or even their mixture), we introduce block modelling into the framework of GCN so that it can realize âblock-guided classified aggregationâ, and automatically learn the corresponding aggregation rules for neighbors of different classes. By incorporating block modelling into the aggregation process, GCN is able to automatically aggregate information from homophilic and heterophilic neighbors discriminately according to their homophily degree. We compared our algorithm with state-of-art methods which deal with the heterophily problem. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our new approach over existing methods in heterophilic datasets while maintaining a competitive performance in homophilic datasets.},
