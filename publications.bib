	abstract = {Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research.},

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of mobile data and the unprecedented demand for computing power, resource-constrained edge devices cannot effectively meet the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and Deep Neural Network (DNN) computing. As a distributed computing paradigm, edge offloading that migrates complex tasks from IoT devices to edge-cloud servers can break through the resource limitation of IoT devices, reduce the computing burden and improve the efficiency of task processing. However, the problem of optimal offloading decision-making is NP-hard, traditional optimization methods are difficult to achieve results efficiently. Besides, there are still some shortcomings in existing deep learning methods, e.g., the slow learning speed and the weak adaptability to new environments. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Deep Meta Reinforcement Learning-based Offloading (DMRO) algorithm, which combines multiple parallel DNNs with Q-learning to make fine-grained offloading decisions. By aggregating the perceptive ability of deep learning, the decision-making ability of reinforcement learning, and the rapid environment learning ability of meta-learning, it is possible to quickly and flexibly obtain the optimal offloading strategy from a dynamic environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of DMRO through several simulation experiments, which demonstrate that when compared with traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, the offloading effect of DMRO can be improved by 17.6\%. In addition, the model has strong portability when making real-time offloading decisions, and can fast adapt to a new MEC task environment.},

In order to make the propagation and aggregation mechanism of GCN suitable for both homophily and heterophily (or even their mixture), we introduce block modelling into the framework of GCN so that it can realize “block-guided classified aggregation”, and automatically learn the corresponding aggregation rules for neighbors of different classes. By incorporating block modelling into the aggregation process, GCN is able to automatically aggregate information from homophilic and heterophilic neighbors discriminately according to their homophily degree. We compared our algorithm with state-of-art methods which deal with the heterophily problem. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our new approach over existing methods in heterophilic datasets while maintaining a competitive performance in homophilic datasets.},

In this paper we propose a neural recommendation approach with personalized attention to learn personalized representations of users and items from reviews. We use a review encoder to learn representations of reviews from words, and a user/item encoder to learn representations of users or items from reviews.

	abstract = {Community detection is a research hotspot in machine learning and data mining. However, most of the existing community detection methods only rely on the lower-order connectivity patterns, while ignoring the higher-order connectivity patterns, and unable to capture the building blocks of the complex network. In recent years, some community detection methods based on higher-order structures have been developed, but they mainly focus on the motif network composed of higher-order structures, which violate the original lower-order topological structure and are affected by the fragmentation issue, resulting in the deviation of community detection results. Therefore, there is still a lack of community detection methods that can effectively utilize higher-order connectivity patterns and lower-order connectivity patterns. To overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes the Hybrid-order Stochastic Block Model (HSBM) from the perspective of the generative model. Based on the classical stochastic block model, the generation of lower-order structure and higher-order structure of the network is modeled uniformly, and the original topological properties of the network are maintained while using higher-order connectivity patterns. At the same time, a heuristic algorithm for community detection is proposed to optimize the objective function. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches.},

However, almost all the existing methods are designed for capturing a relaxation of automorphic equivalence or regular equivalence. They may be good at structure identification but could show poorer performance on role identification. Because automorphic equivalence and regular equivalence strictly tie the role of a node to the identities of all its neighbors. To mitigate this problem, we construct a framework called Curvature-based Network Embedding with Stochastic Equivalence (CNESE) to embed stochastic equivalence. More specifically, we estimate the role distribution of nodes based on discrete Ricci curvature for its excellent ability to concisely representing local topology. We use a Variational Auto-Encoder to generate embeddings while a degree-guided regularizer and a contrastive learning regularizer are leveraged to improving both its robustness and discrimination ability. The effectiveness of our proposed CNESE is demonstrated by extensive experiments on real-world networks.},

However, the constrained battery capacity of IoT devices greatly limits the user experience. Energy harvesting technologies enable green energy to provide continuous energy support for devices in the IoT environment. Together with the maturity of the mobile edge computing technology and the development of parallel computing, it provides a strong guarantee for the normal operation of resource-constrained IoT devices. In this article, we design a parallel offloading strategy based on Lyapunov optimization, which is conducive to efficiently finding the optimal decision for delay-sensitive and compute-intensive tasks. We establish a stochastic optimization problem on a discrete-time slot system and propose a green parallel online offloading algorithm (GPOOA). By decoupling the target problem three times, the joint optimization of green energy, task division factor, CPU frequency, and transmission power is realized. Experimental results demonstrate that under the constraints of strict task deadlines and limited server computing resources, GPOOA performs well in terms of system cost and task drop ratio, far superior to several existing offloading algorithms.},

	abstract = {Finding semantic communities using network topology and contents together is a hot topic in community detection. Existing methods often use word attributes in an indiscriminate way to help finding communities. Through analysis we find that, words in networked contents often embody a hierarchical semantic structure. Some words reflect a background topic of the whole network with all communities, some imply the high-level general topic covering several topic-related communities, and some imply the high-resolution specialized topic to describe each community. Ignoring such semantic structures often leads to defects in depicting networked contents where deep semantics are not fully utilized. To solve this problem, we propose a new Bayesian probabilistic model. By distinguishing words from either a background topic or some two-level topics (i.e., general and specialized topics), this model not only better utilizes the networked contents to help finding communities, but also provides a clearer multiplex semantic community interpretation. We then give an efficient variational algorithm for model inference. The superiority of this new approach is demonstrated by comparing with ten state-of-the-art methods on nine real networks and an artificial benchmark. A case study is further provided to show its strong ability in deep semantic interpretation of communities.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of mobile devices, intelligent applications, e.g., face recognition, intelligent voice assistant, and gesture recognition, have been widely used in our daily lives. However, due to the lack of computing capacities, it is difficult for mobile devices to support complex Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference. To alleviate the pressure on these devices, traditional methods usually upload part of the DNN model to a cloud server and perform a DNN query after uploading an entire DNN model. To achieve real-time DNN query, we consider the collaboration between local, edge and cloud, and perform DNN query when uploading DNN partitions. In this paper, we propose an Efficient offloading scheme for DNN Inference Acceleration (EosDNN) in a local-edge-cloud collaborative environment, where the DNN inference acceleration is mainly embodied in the optimization of migration delay and realization of real-time DNN query. EosDNN comprehensively considers the migration plan and uploading plan, where for the former, a Particle Swarm Optimization with Genetic Algorithm (PSO-GA) is applied to obtain the distribution of DNN layers under the server with the lowest migration delay, and for the latter, a Layer Merge Uploading Algorithm (LMU) is proposed to obtain DNN partitions and their upload order with efficient DNN query performance. Experimental results demonstrate that EosDNN can be applied to large-scale DNN model migration, which can achieve an ideal migration delay and obtain a more fine-grained DNN partition uploading plan, thereby optimizing DNN query performance.},

	abstract = {Network embedding is an important class of link prediction methods, which can use the distance between learned low-dimensional node representations to characterize the similarity between nodes. Traditional network embedding methods focus on single-layer networks, while in reality, a large part of complex networks are not isolated, but interdependent and interrelated, forming multiplex complex networks. Also, how to effectively exploit layer correlations in multiplex networks to learn more robust and valuable representations, to improve link prediction performance, has been a hot research topic in the field of complex network analysis. However, previous studies mainly focus on inferring intralinks in each layer of complex networks or anchor links among layers. Another issue that has not been discussed is how to predict potential links or reconstruct the network in unobserved relations based on existing multiplex networks. To this issue, we define a novel inductive link prediction problem in multiplex networks, in which most existing multichannel network embedding methods fail to solve. This is either because they only emphasize the specific structure information of an individual layer or only capture the common information for all layers. To effectively address this problem, we propose a novel embedding method termed interactive learning across relations (ILAR), to capture and fully exploit the multiple relations and complex layer correlations in multiplex networks. We leverage two convolutional modules and ILAR to capture the sufficient complementary and correlations in multiplex networks. Moreover, during interactive learning, a disparity constraint is introduced, which enforces the features encoded from two convolutional modules to be different and prevents information redundancy. Finally, the extensive experiments in several real-world datasets show that our model can significantly outperform the existing state-of-the-art network embedding methods on the novel link prediction problem in multiplex networks.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.},

	abstract = {Recently, network embedding (NE) is an amazing research point in complex networks and devoted to a variety of tasks. Nearly, all the methods and models of NE are based on the local, high-order, or global similarity of the networks, and few studies have focused on the role discovery or structural similarity, which is of great significance in spreading dynamics and network theory. Meanwhile, existing NE models for role discovery suffer from two limitations, that is: 1) they fail to model the varying dependencies between each node and its neighbor nodes and 2) they cannot capture the effective node features which are helpful to role discovery, which makes these methods ineffective when applied to the role discovery task. To solve the above problems of NE for role discovery or structural similarity, we propose a unified deep learning framework, called RDAA, which can effectively represent features of nodes and benefit the Role Discovery-guided NE with a deep autoencoder, while modeling the local links with an Attention mechanism. In addition, we design an elaborately binding technique to combine both parts and optimize the framework in a unified way. We conduct different experiments, including visualization, role classification, role discovery, and running time compared to popular NE methods for both proximity and structural similarity. The RDAA has better performance on all the datasets and achieves good tradeoffs.},

A variety of methods, such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model, has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving the accuracy of dynamic community detection.},

In addition to the input review, the quality of generated summaries is highly related to the characteristics of users and products, e.g., their historical summaries, which could provide useful clues for the target summary generation. However, most previous works ignore the underlying interaction between the given input review and the corresponding historical summaries. Therefore, we aim to explore how to effectively incorporate the history information into the summary generation. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based reasoning framework for personalized review summarization. We design an elaborately adapted transformer network containing an encoder and a decoder, to fully infer the important and informative parts among the historical summaries in terms of the input review to generate more comprehensive summaries. In the encoder of our approach, we develop an inter- and intra-attention to involve the history information selectively to learn the personalized representation of the input review. In the decoder part, we propose to incorporate the constructed reasoning memory learning from historical summaries into the original transformer decoder, and design a memory-decoder attention module to retrieve more useful information for the final summary generation. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results show our approach could generate more reasonable summaries for recommendation, and outperform many competitive baseline methods.},

One of the promising techniques for finding overlapping communities is the popular stochastic models, which, unfortunately, have some common drawbacks. They do not support an important observation that highly connected nodes are more likely to reside in the overlapping regions of communities in the network. These methods are in essence not truly unsupervised, since they require a threshold on probabilistic memberships to derive overlapping structures and need the number of communities to be specified
              a priori
              . We develop a new method to address these issues for overlapping community detection. We first present a stochastic model to accommodate the relative importance and the expected degree of every node in each community. We then infer every overlapping community by ranking the nodes according to their importance. Second, we determine the number of communities under the Bayesian framework. We evaluate our method and compare it with five state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. We also apply this new method to two applications, showing its superb performance on practical problems.},

As the most popular and successful network model, the stochastic block model (SBM) has been extended and applied to community detection, link prediction, anomaly detection, and evolution analysis of dynamic networks. However, all current models based on the SBM for modeling dynamic networks are designed at the community level, assuming that nodes in each community have the same dynamic behavior, which usually results in poor performance on temporal community detection and loses the modeling of node abnormal behavior. To solve the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes a hierarchical Bayesian dynamic SBM (HB-DSBM) for modeling the node-level and community-level dynamic behavior in a dynamic network synchronously. Based on the SBM, we introduce a hierarchical Dirichlet generative mechanism to associate the global community evolution with the microscopic transition behavior of nodes near-perfectly and generate the observed links across the dynamic networks. Meanwhile, an effective variational inference algorithm is developed and we can easy to infer the communities and dynamic behaviors of the nodes. Furthermore, with the two-level evolution behaviors, it can identify nodes or communities with abnormal behavior. Experiments on simulated and real-world networks demonstrate that HB-DSBM has achieved state-of-the-art performance on community detection and evolution. In addition, abnormal evolutionary behavior and events on dynamic networks can be effectively identified by our model.},

	abstract = {Network representation learning or embedding aims to project the network into a low-dimensional space that can be devoted to different network tasks. Temporal networks are an important type of network whose topological structure changes over time. Compared with methods on static networks, temporal network embedding (TNE) methods are facing three challenges: 1) it cannot describe the temporal dependence across network snapshots; 2) the node embedding in the latent space fails to indicate changes in the network topology; and 3) it cannot avoid a lot of redundant computation via parameter inheritance on a series of snapshots. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel TNE method named temporal network embedding method based on the VAE framework (TVAE), which is based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to capture the evolution of temporal networks for link prediction. It not only generates low-dimensional embedding vectors for nodes but also preserves the dynamic nonlinear features of temporal networks. Through the combination of a self-attention mechanism and recurrent neural networks, TVAE can update node representations and keep the temporal dependence of vectors over time. We utilize parameter inheritance to keep the new embedding close to the previous one, rather than explicitly using regularization, and thus, it is effective for large-scale networks. We evaluate our model and several baselines on synthetic data sets and real-world networks. The experimental results demonstrate that TVAE has superior performance and lower time cost compared with the baselines.},

Furthermore, the only existing methods for bipartite network embedding ignore the internal mechanism and highly nonlinear structures of links. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new deep learning method to learn the node embedding for bipartite networks based on the widely used autoencoder framework. Moreover, we carefully devise a node-level triplet including two types of nodes to assign the embedding by integrating the local and global structures. Meanwhile, we apply the variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep generation model with natural advantages in data generation and reconstruction, to enhance the node embedding for the highly nonlinear relationships between nodes and complex features.

Macroscopic prediction estimates the overall impact of information diffusion, while microscopic prediction focuses on identifying the next user to be influenced. While prior research often concentrates on one of these aspects, a few tackle both concurrently. These two tasks provide complementary insights into the diffusion process at different levels, revealing common traits and unique attributes. The exploration of leveraging common features across these tasks to enhance information prediction remains an underexplored avenue. In this paper, we propose an intuitive and effective model that addresses both macroscopic and microscopic prediction tasks. Our approach considers the interactions and dynamics among cascades at the macro level and incorporates the social homophily of users in social networks at the micro level. Additionally, we introduce adversarial training and orthogonality constraints to ensure the integrity of shared features.

On such network is edgesmissing network, where some relationships (edges) between two entities are missing. Recently, several works have been proposed to solve this problem by combining link prediction and community detection in a two-stage method or in a uniﬁed framework. However, the goal of link prediction, which is to predict as many correct edges as possible, is not consistent with the requirement that is predicting important edges for identifying communities on edges-missing networks. Thus, combining link prediction and community detection cannot work very well in terms of detecting community structure for edges-missing networks. In this paper, we propose a community self-guided generative model which jointly completes the edges-missing network and identiﬁes communities. In our new model, completing missing edges and identifying communities are not isolated but closely intertwined. Furthermore, we developed an effective model inference method that combines a nested ExpectationMaximization algorithm and Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Extensive experiments on real-world edges-missing networks show that our model can effectively detect community structures while completing missing edges.},

However, the correlations among layers in multiplex networks are diverse, which go beyond the connectivity consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel Modeling Correlations for Multiplex network Embedding (MCME) framework to learn the robust node representations for each layer. It can deal with complex correlations with a common structure, layer similarity and node heterogeneity through a unified framework in multiplex networks.

	abstract = {Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with multiple entity and relation types are common in real-world networks. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have shown promise for learning HG representations. However, most HGNNs are designed for static HGs and are not compatible with heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs). A few existing works have focused on HTG representation learning but they care more about how to capture the dynamic evolutions and less about their compatibility with those well-designed static HGNNs. They also handle graph structure and temporal dependency learning separately, ignoring that HTG evolutions are influenced by both nodes and relationships. To address this, we propose HGN2T, a simple and general framework that makes static HGNNs compatible with HTGs. HGN2T is plug-and-play, enabling static HGNNs to leverage their graph structure learning strengths. To capture the relationship-influenced evolutions, we design a special mechanism coupling both the HGNN and sequential model. Finally, through joint optimization by both detection and prediction tasks, the learned representations can fully capture temporal dependencies from historical information. We conduct several empirical evaluation tasks, and the results show our HGN2T can adapt static HGNNs to HTGs and overperform existing methods for HTGs.},
