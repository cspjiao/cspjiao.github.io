abstract: A variety of methods have been proposed for modeling and mining dynamic
  complex networks, in which the topological structure varies with time. As the most
  popular and successful network model, the stochastic block model (SBM) has been
  extended and applied to community detection, link prediction, anomaly detection,
  and evolution analysis of dynamic networks. However, all current models based on
  the SBM for modeling dynamic networks are designed at the community level, assuming
  that nodes in each community have the same dynamic behavior, which usually results
  in poor performance on temporal community detection and loses the modeling of node
  abnormal behavior. To solve the above-mentioned problem, this article proposes a
  hierarchical Bayesian dynamic SBM (HB-DSBM) for modeling the node-level and community-level
  dynamic behavior in a dynamic network synchronously. Based on the SBM, we introduce
  a hierarchical Dirichlet generative mechanism to associate the global community
  evolution with the microscopic transition behavior of nodes near-perfectly and generate
  the observed links across the dynamic networks. Meanwhile, an effective variational
  inference algorithm is developed and we can easy to infer the communities and dynamic
  behaviors of the nodes. Furthermore, with the two-level evolution behaviors, it
  can identify nodes or communities with abnormal behavior. Experiments on simulated
  and real-world networks demonstrate that HB-DSBM has achieved state-of-the-art performance
  on community detection and evolution. In addition, abnormal evolutionary behavior
  and events on dynamic networks can be effectively identified by our model.
