abstract: Temporal community detection is helpful to discover and analyze significant
  groups or clusters hidden in dynamic networks in the real world. A variety of methods,
  such as modularity optimization, spectral method, and statistical network model,
  has been developed from diversified perspectives. Recently, network embedding-based
  technologies have made significant progress, and one can exploit deep learning superiority
  to network tasks. Although some methods for static networks have shown promising
  results in boosting community detection by integrating community embedding, they
  are not suitable for temporal networks and unable to capture their dynamics. Furthermore,
  the dynamic embedding methods only model network varying without considering community
  structures. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel unsupervised dynamic community
  detection model, which is based on network embedding and can effectively discover
  temporal communities and model dynamic networks. More specifically, we propose the
  community prior by introducing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the variational
  autoencoder, which can obtain community information and better model the evolutionary
  characteristics of community structure and node embedding by utilizing the variant
  of gated recurrent unit (GRU). Extensive experiments conducted in real-world and
  artificial networks demonstrate that our proposed model has a better effect on improving
  the accuracy of dynamic community detection.
