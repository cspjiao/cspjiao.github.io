 abstract = {The vast majority of community detection algorithms assume that the networks are totally observed. However, in reality many networks cannot be fully observed. On such network is edgesmissing network, where some relationships (edges) between two entities are missing. Recently, several works have been proposed to solve this problem by combining link prediction and community detection in a two-stage method or in a uniﬁed framework. However, the goal of link prediction, which is to predict as many correct edges as possible, is not consistent with the requirement that is predicting important edges for identifying communities on edges-missing networks. Thus, combining link prediction and community detection cannot work very well in terms of detecting community structure for edges-missing networks. In this paper, we propose a community self-guided generative model which jointly completes the edges-missing network and identiﬁes communities. In our new model, completing missing edges and identifying communities are not isolated but closely intertwined. Furthermore, we developed an effective model inference method that combines a nested ExpectationMaximization algorithm and Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Extensive experiments on real-world edges-missing networks show that our model can effectively detect community structures while completing missing edges.},
