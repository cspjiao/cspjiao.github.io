abstract: The vast majority of community detection algorithms assume that the networks
  are totally observed. However, in reality many networks cannot be fully observed.
  On such network is edgesmissing network, where some relationships (edges) between
  two entities are missing. Recently, several works have been proposed to solve this
  problem by combining link prediction and community detection in a two-stage method
  or in a uniﬁed framework. However, the goal of link prediction, which is to predict
  as many correct edges as possible, is not consistent with the requirement that is
  predicting important edges for identifying communities on edges-missing networks.
  Thus, combining link prediction and community detection cannot work very well in
  terms of detecting community structure for edges-missing networks. In this paper,
  we propose a community self-guided generative model which jointly completes the
  edges-missing network and identiﬁes communities. In our new model, completing missing
  edges and identifying communities are not isolated but closely intertwined. Furthermore,
  we developed an effective model inference method that combines a nested ExpectationMaximization
  algorithm and Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Extensive experiments on real-world
  edges-missing networks show that our model can effectively detect community structures
  while completing missing edges.
