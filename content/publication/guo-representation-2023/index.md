abstract: Capturing structural similarity has been a hot topic in the field of network
  embedding (NE) recently due to its great help in understanding node functions and
  behaviors. However, existing works have paid very much attention to learning structures
  on homogeneous networks, while the related study on heterogeneous networks is still
  void. In this article, we try to take the first step for representation learning
  on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations
  of node types and underlying structures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures,
  we first propose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous
  walk (HAW) and give two more applicable variants. Then, we devise the HAW embedding
  (HAWE) and its variants in a data-driven manner to circumvent using an extremely
  large number of possible walks and train embeddings by predicting occurring walks
  in the neighborhood of each node. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative
  experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure
  learning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate
  our methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and heterogeneous
  classic methods and can be applied on large-scale networks.
