abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g.,
  nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from
  the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction
  tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies
  of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation
  and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the
  anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements,
  i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible
  behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze
  the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS).
  It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network)
  of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure
  and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community
  membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we
  also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed
  generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal
  evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously,
  besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an
  effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results
  show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community
  structure compared with baselines.
