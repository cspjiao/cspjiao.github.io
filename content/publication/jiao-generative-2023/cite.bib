 abstract = {Anomaly detection in dynamic networks aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs, change points) with significantly different behaviors from the vast majority, it can also devote to community detection and evolution and prediction tasks. Most existing methods focus on one specific task, that is, only detect anomalies of one type of element isolated, so they lose the ability to model the correlation and driving mechanism between different abnormal behavior. Considering that the anomaly detection of one type of element is helpful to other types of elements, i.e., the temporal evolution hidden the dynamic networks are driven by indivisible behavior patterns. So in this paper, we propose a unified Generation model to analyze the dynamic network for Exploring the Abnormal Behaviors of different Scales (GEABS). It can model the relation and catch different levels (node, community and network) of anomaly with a joint statistical network model and detect the community structure and its evolution. Specifically, we denote the parameters of node popularity, community membership to generate the dynamic network with stochastic block model (SBM), we also describe the varying of node and community by dynamic process. With a well-designed generative mechanism, it can detect the change point on network level, temporal evolution on community level and abnormal behavior on node level synchronously, besides, it also detects the community structure effectively. We also propose an effective optimization algorithm with variational inference. Experimental results show that the GEABS achieves better performance on abnormal behavior and community structure compared with baselines.},
