abstract: 'Recently, network embedding (NE) is an amazing research point in complex
  networks and devoted to a variety of tasks. Nearly, all the methods and models of
  NE are based on the local, high-order, or global similarity of the networks, and
  few studies have focused on the role discovery or structural similarity, which is
  of great significance in spreading dynamics and network theory. Meanwhile, existing
  NE models for role discovery suffer from two limitations, that is: 1) they fail
  to model the varying dependencies between each node and its neighbor nodes and 2)
  they cannot capture the effective node features which are helpful to role discovery,
  which makes these methods ineffective when applied to the role discovery task. To
  solve the above problems of NE for role discovery or structural similarity, we propose
  a unified deep learning framework, called RDAA, which can effectively represent
  features of nodes and benefit the Role Discovery-guided NE with a deep autoencoder,
  while modeling the local links with an Attention mechanism. In addition, we design
  an elaborately binding technique to combine both parts and optimize the framework
  in a unified way. We conduct different experiments, including visualization, role
  classification, role discovery, and running time compared to popular NE methods
  for both proximity and structural similarity. The RDAA has better performance on
  all the datasets and achieves good tradeoffs.'
