abstract: Network embedding is an important class of link prediction methods, which
  can use the distance between learned low-dimensional node representations to characterize
  the similarity between nodes. Traditional network embedding methods focus on single-layer
  networks, while in reality, a large part of complex networks are not isolated, but
  interdependent and interrelated, forming multiplex complex networks. Also, how to
  effectively exploit layer correlations in multiplex networks to learn more robust
  and valuable representations, to improve link prediction performance, has been a
  hot research topic in the field of complex network analysis. However, previous studies
  mainly focus on inferring intralinks in each layer of complex networks or anchor
  links among layers. Another issue that has not been discussed is how to predict
  potential links or reconstruct the network in unobserved relations based on existing
  multiplex networks. To this issue, we define a novel inductive link prediction problem
  in multiplex networks, in which most existing multichannel network embedding methods
  fail to solve. This is either because they only emphasize the specific structure
  information of an individual layer or only capture the common information for all
  layers. To effectively address this problem, we propose a novel embedding method
  termed interactive learning across relations (ILAR), to capture and fully exploit
  the multiple relations and complex layer correlations in multiplex networks. We
  leverage two convolutional modules and ILAR to capture the sufficient complementary
  and correlations in multiplex networks. Moreover, during interactive learning, a
  disparity constraint is introduced, which enforces the features encoded from two
  convolutional modules to be different and prevents information redundancy. Finally,
  the extensive experiments in several real-world datasets show that our model can
  significantly outperform the existing state-of-the-art network embedding methods
  on the novel link prediction problem in multiplex networks.
