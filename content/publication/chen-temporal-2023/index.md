abstract: Temporal graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional
  dynamic node embeddings to capture temporal information as well as structural and
  property information. Current representation learning methods for temporal networks
  often focus on capturing fine-grained information, which may lead to the model capturing
  random noise instead of essential semantic information. While graph contrastive
  learning has shown promise in dealing with noise, it only applies to static graphs
  or snapshots and may not be suitable for handling time-dependent noise. To alleviate
  the above challenge, we propose a novel Temporal Graph representation learning with
  Adaptive augmentation Contrastive (TGAC) model. The adaptive augmentation on the
  temporal graph is made by combining prior knowledge with temporal information, and
  the contrastive objective function is constructed by defining the augmented inter-view
  contrast and intra-view contrast. To complement TGAC, we propose three adaptive
  augmentation strategies that modify topological features to reduce noise from the
  network. Our extensive experiments on various real networks demonstrate that the
  proposed model outperforms other temporal graph representation learning methods.
