 abstract = {Temporal graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional dynamic node embeddings to capture temporal information as well as structural and property information. Current representation learning methods for temporal networks often focus on capturing fine-grained information, which may lead to the model capturing random noise instead of essential semantic information. While graph contrastive learning has shown promise in dealing with noise, it only applies to static graphs or snapshots and may not be suitable for handling time-dependent noise. To alleviate the above challenge, we propose a novel Temporal Graph representation learning with Adaptive augmentation Contrastive (TGAC) model. The adaptive augmentation on the temporal graph is made by combining prior knowledge with temporal information, and the contrastive objective function is constructed by defining the augmented inter-view contrast and intra-view contrast. To complement TGAC, we propose three adaptive augmentation strategies that modify topological features to reduce noise from the network. Our extensive experiments on various real networks demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other temporal graph representation learning methods.},
