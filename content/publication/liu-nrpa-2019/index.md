abstract: Existing review-based recommendation methods usually use the same model
  to learn the representations of all users/items from reviews posted by users towards
  items. However, different users have different preference and different items have
  different characteristics. Thus, the same word or the similar reviews may have different
  informativeness for different users and items. In this paper we propose a neural
  recommendation approach with personalized attention to learn personalized representations
  of users and items from reviews. We use a review encoder to learn representations
  of reviews from words, and a user/item encoder to learn representations of users
  or items from reviews. We propose a personalized attention model, and apply it to
  both review and user/item encoders to select different important words and reviews
  for different users/items. Experiments on five datasets validate our approach can
  effectively improve the performance of neural recommendation.
