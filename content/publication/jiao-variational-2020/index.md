abstract: As a powerful tool for machine learning on the graph, network embedding,
  which projects nodes into low-dimensional spaces, has a variety of applications
  on complex networks. Most current methods and models are not suitable for bipartite
  networks, which have two different types of nodes and there are no links between
  nodes of the same type. Furthermore, the only existing methods for bipartite network
  embedding ignore the internal mechanism and highly nonlinear structures of links.
  Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new deep learning method to learn the node
  embedding for bipartite networks based on the widely used autoencoder framework.
  Moreover, we carefully devise a node-level triplet including two types of nodes
  to assign the embedding by integrating the local and global structures. Meanwhile,
  we apply the variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep generation model with natural
  advantages in data generation and reconstruction, to enhance the node embedding
  for the highly nonlinear relationships between nodes and complex features. Experiments
  on some widely used datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model and corresponding
  algorithm compared with some baseline network (and bipartite) embedding techniques.
