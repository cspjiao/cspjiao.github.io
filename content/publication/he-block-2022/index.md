abstract: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has shown remarkable potential of exploring
  graph representation. However, the GCN aggregating mechanism fails to generalize
  to networks with heterophily where most nodes have neighbors from different classes,
  which commonly exists in real-world networks. In order to make the propagation and
  aggregation mechanism of GCN suitable for both homophily and heterophily (or even
  their mixture), we introduce block modelling into the framework of GCN so that it
  can realize “block-guided classified aggregation”, and automatically learn the corresponding
  aggregation rules for neighbors of different classes. By incorporating block modelling
  into the aggregation process, GCN is able to automatically aggregate information
  from homophilic and heterophilic neighbors discriminately according to their homophily
  degree. We compared our algorithm with state-of-art methods which deal with the
  heterophily problem. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our new approach
  over existing methods in heterophilic datasets while maintaining a competitive performance
  in homophilic datasets.
