abstract: Finding semantic communities using network topology and contents together
  is a hot topic in community detection. Existing methods often use word attributes
  in an indiscriminate way to help finding communities. Through analysis we find that,
  words in networked contents often embody a hierarchical semantic structure. Some
  words reflect a background topic of the whole network with all communities, some
  imply the high-level general topic covering several topic-related communities, and
  some imply the high-resolution specialized topic to describe each community. Ignoring
  such semantic structures often leads to defects in depicting networked contents
  where deep semantics are not fully utilized. To solve this problem, we propose a
  new Bayesian probabilistic model. By distinguishing words from either a background
  topic or some two-level topics (i.e., general and specialized topics), this model
  not only better utilizes the networked contents to help finding communities, but
  also provides a clearer multiplex semantic community interpretation. We then give
  an efficient variational algorithm for model inference. The superiority of this
  new approach is demonstrated by comparing with ten state-of-the-art methods on nine
  real networks and an artificial benchmark. A case study is further provided to show
  its strong ability in deep semantic interpretation of communities.
