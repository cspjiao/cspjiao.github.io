abstract: In order to meet peopleâ€™s demands for intelligent and user-friendly Internet
  of Things (IoT) services, the amount of computation is increasing rapidly and the
  requirements of task delay are becoming increasingly more stringent. However, the
  constrained battery capacity of IoT devices greatly limits the user experience.
  Energy harvesting technologies enable green energy to provide continuous energy
  support for devices in the IoT environment. Together with the maturity of the mobile
  edge computing technology and the development of parallel computing, it provides
  a strong guarantee for the normal operation of resource-constrained IoT devices.
  In this article, we design a parallel offloading strategy based on Lyapunov optimization,
  which is conducive to efficiently finding the optimal decision for delay-sensitive
  and compute-intensive tasks. We establish a stochastic optimization problem on a
  discrete-time slot system and propose a green parallel online offloading algorithm
  (GPOOA). By decoupling the target problem three times, the joint optimization of
  green energy, task division factor, CPU frequency, and transmission power is realized.
  Experimental results demonstrate that under the constraints of strict task deadlines
  and limited server computing resources, GPOOA performs well in terms of system cost
  and task drop ratio, far superior to several existing offloading algorithms.
