abstract: Federated Learning (FL) empowers multiple clients to collaboratively learn
  a global generalization model without the need to share their local data, thus reducing
  privacy risks and expanding the scope of AI applications. However, current works
  focus less on data in a highly nonidentically distributed manner such as graph data
  which are common in reality, and ignore the problem of model personalization between
  clients for graph data training in federated learning. In this paper, we propose
  a novel personality graph federated learning framework based on variational graph
  autoencoders that incorporates model contrastive learning and local fine-tuning
  to achieve personalized federated training on graph data for each client, which
  is called FedVGAE. Then we introduce an encoder-sharing strategy to the proposed
  framework that shares the parameters of the encoder layer to further improve personality
  performance. The node classification and link prediction experiments demonstrate
  that our method achieves better performance than other federated learning methods
  on most graph datasets in the non-iid setting. Finally, we conduct ablation experiments,
  the result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.
