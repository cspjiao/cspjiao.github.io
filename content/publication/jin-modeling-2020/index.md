abstract: Overlapping community detection has triggered recent research in network
  analysis. One of the promising techniques for finding overlapping communities is
  the popular stochastic models, which, unfortunately, have some common drawbacks.
  They do not support an important observation that highly connected nodes are more
  likely to reside in the overlapping regions of communities in the network. These
  methods are in essence not truly unsupervised, since they require a threshold on
  probabilistic memberships to derive overlapping structures and need the number of
  communities to be specified a priori . We develop a new method to address these
  issues for overlapping community detection. We first present a stochastic model
  to accommodate the relative importance and the expected degree of every node in
  each community. We then infer every overlapping community by ranking the nodes according
  to their importance. Second, we determine the number of communities under the Bayesian
  framework. We evaluate our method and compare it with five state-of-the-art methods.
  The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. We also apply this
  new method to two applications, showing its superb performance on practical problems.
