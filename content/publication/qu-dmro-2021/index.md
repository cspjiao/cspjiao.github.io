abstract: With the explosive growth of mobile data and the unprecedented demand for
  computing power, resource-constrained edge devices cannot effectively meet the requirements
  of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and Deep Neural Network (DNN) computing.
  As a distributed computing paradigm, edge offloading that migrates complex tasks
  from IoT devices to edge-cloud servers can break through the resource limitation
  of IoT devices, reduce the computing burden and improve the efficiency of task processing.
  However, the problem of optimal offloading decision-making is NP-hard, traditional
  optimization methods are difficult to achieve results efficiently. Besides, there
  are still some shortcomings in existing deep learning methods, e.g., the slow learning
  speed and the weak adaptability to new environments. To tackle these challenges,
  we propose a Deep Meta Reinforcement Learning-based Offloading (DMRO) algorithm,
  which combines multiple parallel DNNs with Q-learning to make fine-grained offloading
  decisions. By aggregating the perceptive ability of deep learning, the decision-making
  ability of reinforcement learning, and the rapid environment learning ability of
  meta-learning, it is possible to quickly and flexibly obtain the optimal offloading
  strategy from a dynamic environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of DMRO through
  several simulation experiments, which demonstrate that when compared with traditional
  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, the offloading effect of DMRO can
  be improved by 17.6%. In addition, the model has strong portability when making
  real-time offloading decisions, and can fast adapt to a new MEC task environment.
