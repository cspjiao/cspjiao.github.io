 abstract = {Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with multiple entity and relation types are common in real-world networks. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have shown promise for learning HG representations. However, most HGNNs are designed for static HGs and are not compatible with heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs). A few existing works have focused on HTG representation learning but they care more about how to capture the dynamic evolutions and less about their compatibility with those well-designed static HGNNs. They also handle graph structure and temporal dependency learning separately, ignoring that HTG evolutions are influenced by both nodes and relationships. To address this, we propose HGN2T, a simple and general framework that makes static HGNNs compatible with HTGs. HGN2T is plug-and-play, enabling static HGNNs to leverage their graph structure learning strengths. To capture the relationship-influenced evolutions, we design a special mechanism coupling both the HGNN and sequential model. Finally, through joint optimization by both detection and prediction tasks, the learned representations can fully capture temporal dependencies from historical information. We conduct several empirical evaluation tasks, and the results show our HGN2T can adapt static HGNNs to HTGs and overperform existing methods for HTGs.},
