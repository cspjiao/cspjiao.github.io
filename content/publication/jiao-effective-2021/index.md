abstract: The dependencies across different layers are an important property in multiplex
  networks and a few methods have been proposed to learn the dependencies in various
  ways. When capturing the dependencies across different layers, some of them assumed
  the structure among layers following consistent connectivity to force two nodes
  with a link in one layer tend to have links in other layers, some introduced a common
  vector to model the shared information across all layers. However, the correlations
  among layers in multiplex networks are diverse, which go beyond the connectivity
  consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel Modeling Correlations for Multiplex
  network Embedding (MCME) framework to learn the robust node representations for
  each layer. It can deal with complex correlations with a common structure, layer
  similarity and node heterogeneity through a unified framework in multiplex networks.
  To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on several real-world
  datasets and the results demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods.
