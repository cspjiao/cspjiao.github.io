abstract: Role-based network embedding methods aim to preserve node-centric connectivity
  patterns, which are expressions of node roles, into low-dimensional vectors. However,
  almost all the existing methods are designed for capturing a relaxation of automorphic
  equivalence or regular equivalence. They may be good at structure identification
  but could show poorer performance on role identification. Because automorphic equivalence
  and regular equivalence strictly tie the role of a node to the identities of all
  its neighbors. To mitigate this problem, we construct a framework called Curvature-based
  Network Embedding with Stochastic Equivalence (CNESE) to embed stochastic equivalence.
  More specifically, we estimate the role distribution of nodes based on discrete
  Ricci curvature for its excellent ability to concisely representing local topology.
  We use a Variational Auto-Encoder to generate embeddings while a degree-guided regularizer
  and a contrastive learning regularizer are leveraged to improving both its robustness
  and discrimination ability. The effectiveness of our proposed CNESE is demonstrated
  by extensive experiments on real-world networks.
