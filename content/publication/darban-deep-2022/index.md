abstract: Time series anomaly detection has applications in a wide range of research
  fields and applications, including manufacturing and healthcare. The presence of
  anomalies can indicate novel or unexpected events, such as production faults, system
  defects, or heart fluttering, and is therefore of particular interest. The large
  size and complex patterns of time series have led researchers to develop specialised
  deep learning models for detecting anomalous patterns. This survey focuses on providing
  structured and comprehensive state-of-the-art time series anomaly detection models
  through the use of deep learning. It providing a taxonomy based on the factors that
  divide anomaly detection models into different categories. Aside from describing
  the basic anomaly detection technique for each category, the advantages and limitations
  are also discussed. Furthermore, this study includes examples of deep anomaly detection
  in time series across various application domains in recent years. It finally summarises
  open issues in research and challenges faced while adopting deep anomaly detection
  models.
