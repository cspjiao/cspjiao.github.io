          description: 'Facing the semantic complexity of graph-structured data, the applicant focuses on the challenges of diverse node types, diverse and sparse semantic information, complex topological attribute interaction and diverse generation mechanisms in complex graphs, and effectively breaks through the difficulties of complex graph attribute semantic diversity and topological attribute interaction. Promoted the generative integration of probabilistic graph model and deep learning method in node and sublayer surface, published 12 papers in AAAI, IJCAI, TKDE, TIST, WWW and other journal conferences as the first or corresponding author. And published the review paper "A Survey of Community Detection Approaches: From Statistical Modeling to Deep Learning "(TKDE 2023), cited more than 230 times by Google academics. He applied theoretical methods to social recommendation and knowledge graph, and his related results were published in SIGIR2019, SIGIR2022, WWW2023, and won the NLPCC2019 Outstanding Paper Award. Applied to Internet edge computing, related results are published in (TNSM 2021) and (IoT-J 2021), paper "EEDTO: an energy-efficient dynamic task offloading algorithm for blockchain-enabled IoT-edge-cloud orchestrated "computing" is included in ESI database as a highly cited paper - the number of citations has classified it as the best in its academic field
