Pengfei Jiao has long been engaged in research in the field of graph machine learning, which, as the academic frontier of complex network science and artificial intelligence, is the core of major national strategies such as cyberspace security and data security, and has demonstrated outstanding value in scenarios such as online fraud identification, financial risk assessment and recommendation systems. However, the graph data in the real scene is faced with the complexity of multiple nodes, heterogeneous links and time changes.
However, the graph data in the real scene is faced with the complexity of multiple nodes, heterogeneous links and time changes. Therefore, the applicant faces the problem of representation learning of complex graphs, focusing on 
1. the diversity of topological semantic information in complex graphs;
2. Various structural link modes; 
3. Key challenges such as time evolution and changing behavior.
